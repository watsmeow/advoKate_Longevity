							<h2>Longevity Coaching</h2>
							<p>The Method Perspective is person – centered: you are the main event. All the details of your life to this point matter, and we are here to listen to your story and create solutions for your specific needs and desires. This could be losing 50 pounds, lowering blood pressure, wanting to crawl around with grandkids, looking to hire the right care giver, or navigating the world of senior housing. Our coaches are trained across gerontology with multiple areas of expertise to help advoKate for you in this moment of life. </p>
							<p><b>Below are the primary areas in which we focus with our individuals clients. We know, however, that life isn't seperable into distinct domains, and we truly work to make our coaching holisic in its approach.</b></p>
							<ul class="alt">
								<li>
									<h3>Wellness: Multidimensional Fitness, Nourishment, and Mindfulness</h3>
									<p>We use a model incorporating 10 domains of wellness to optimize fitness, nutrition, strength training, mindset management, spiritual fulfillment, environmental health, financial independence, and so much more… Wellness is not just part of our model: it’s the umbrella that sits over a well-lived life.</p>
								</li>								
								<li>
									<h3>Social Engagement: Connection, Community, Enrichment</h3>
									<p>Social connection is foundational to health! So are activities and challenges that engage and inspire the mind, body, and soul. More focus in this area produces tangible longevity results. Whether it’s scripted dinner conversations, trips to Baja, wellness retreats, or bucket-list “should’s” - we’re all guilty of waiting for the right time. The right time is created with a little extra support identifying priorities in tandem with a lifespan lens. </p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<h3>Environment: Health Design and Home Modifications</h3>
									<p>Home is where the heart - health is! Environment dictates success. Working together, much can be done to optimize home spaces to prioritize the happenings of community, healthy habits, and ability-friendly, inclusive layouts. Nine out of Ten Americans want to age at home: our mission is to help accomplish this goal with foresight and beautiful, brilliant design. </p>
